/* Question 1: a parameter is a placeholder variiable defined when a function is created. This allows a user or another developer to pass arguments to the function when they call the function from a different piece of code. Depending on the function's creator, the parameters defined maybe mandatory or optional. */

/* Question 2: console.log sends the completed function, or part of it, to a browser's - or editor's - console window. return, on the other hand, sends the results of (or returns to) the function to the piece of code that's calling it */

/* Question 3: letting a function return a value lets javascript, and other languages, influence the behavior of web pages and applications. This can make them dynamic */
